### Human-Wildlife Coexistence Incidents in Parks Canada
This project analyzes a dataset of human-wildlife coexistence incidents managed by Parks Canada. The dataset contains detailed records of incidents reported between 2010 and 2021 in various national parks and historic sites across Canada.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to understand the most common types of human-wildlife coexistence incidents reported in national parks and historic sites in Canada. Additionally, we wanted to analyze how the number of incidents has changed over time, identify which sites have the highest number of incidents, and determine if there are any seasonal or geographic trends in the occurrence of these incidents.

### Questions Answered
The following questions were addressed in this project:

   - What is the most common type of human-wildlife coexistence incident reported across all parks and historic sites?
   - How has the number of hwc incidents changed over time from 2010 to 2021?
   - Which national park or historic site has the highest number of human-wildlife coexistence incidents reported? And lowest
   - Are there any seasonal or geographic trends in the occurrence of human-wildlife coexistence incidents?
   - What is the average response time by Parks Canada staff to human-wildlife coexistence incidents?

### Methodology
To answer these questions, we performed data analysis using Python and various libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and geopandas. We read in the dataset, cleaned and processed the data, and then conducted various analyses to answer the questions.

For example, to determine the most common type of incident reported, we grouped the data by incident type and counted the number of incidents for each type. We then plotted this information on a horizontal bar chart to visualize the results.

### Results
Our analysis revealed that the most common type of human-wildlife coexistence incident reported across all parks and historic sites is "Human-Wildlife Interaction," and the least common is "Domestic Animal Incident." We also found that the number of incidents has increased over time until 2020 when COVID-19 occurred, which temporarily decreased the number of visitors. We identified the sites with the highest number of incidents reported, which can help visitors to these sites take appropriate precautions to minimize risks. Finally, we analyzed the geographic and seasonal trends in the occurrence of incidents.

### Conclusion
Our analysis provides valuable insights into the human-wildlife coexistence incidents in Parks Canada. By identifying the most common types of incidents and the sites with the highest number of incidents reported, we can better understand the potential risks associated with visiting these parks and take appropriate measures to minimize them.
